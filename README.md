## Repo for components of program engineering 2 tasks ##


### Task 1 ###
  * Choose array fn (map/filter/filterMap/some/find/findIndex): [viewcode](https://github.com/YKantur/cpi2-labs/blob/main/task1.js#L8-L11)
  * Prepare its callback based async counterpart: [viewcode](https://github.com/YKantur/cpi2-labs/blob/main/task1.js#L1-L6), [viewcode](https://github.com/YKantur/cpi2-labs/blob/main/task1.js#L8-L38)
  * Prepare demo cases for the usage: [viewcode](https://github.com/YKantur/cpi2-labs/blob/main/task1.js#L40-L69)
  * Add new on-demend feature during review
    e.g.: Add support for debounce (if the task took less then X time to
    complete -- add an additional execution delya): [viewcode](https://github.com/YKantur/cpi2-labs/blob/main/task1.js#L40-L54)

### Task 2 ###
  * Prepare promise based alternative
  * Write use cases for the promise based solution
  * Write use cases for the async-await
  * Add new on-demend feature during review
    e.g.: Add support for parallelism

  Note: for technologies that do not have the native Future-like async functionalities
  You may combine Task 1 and 2 into a single Task that will showcase the idiomatic way of handling concurrency.
 
### Task 3 ###
  * Integrate AbortController or other Cancallable approach

### Task 4 ### 
  * (Stream/AsyncIterator/Alternative) -- Ongoing processing of large data sets that do not fit in memory

### Task 5 ### 
  * (Observable/EventEmitter/Alternative) -- Reactive message based communication between entities
